        <h2>Building a Project that References Other Projects<a name="kanchor3286"></a></h2>
        <p>To ensure that a project that references other projects is compiled correctly, set the following options on the IDL Build Properties page of the <b>Project Properties</b> dialog:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Create a save file</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The idea behind using this option is to ensure that all the code from your referenced projects is included in the main project build. If you select this option for every referenced project, a SAVE file is created when every referenced project is built, and the contents of these SAVE files are added to the main project. In this context, the SAVE files are used as part of the internal build process.</p>
        <p>If you select the <b>Create a save file</b> option for the main project as well, the resulting SAVE file contains code from both the referenced projects and the main project, and can be used to distribute that code to others.</p>
        <p>The safest path is to select this option for the main project and all referenced projects. By doing this, the main project build will always include the code from the main project and all referenced projects.</p>
        <p>By default, if you build a main project and all referenced projects in the same session, intermediate SAVE files are automatically created for the referenced projects, and these SAVE files are incorporated into the main project. However, if you build a project in a separate session (by selecting the <b>Build in a separate IDL session</b> property), you must explicitly create a project SAVE file to include the code in the main project because the special session is destroyed after the project is built.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Execute .RESET_SESSION before building project</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>OR</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Build in a separate IDL session</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Either of these options creates a <i>clean</i> session, in which previously-compiled routines and previously-defined variables are removed. Creating a clean session ensures that everything your application requires is in fact being compiled and stored in the resulting SAVE file.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note: </b></span></span>If you select the <b>Build in a separate IDL session</b> property, you must also select the <b>Create a save file</b> property in order to include the project code in the main project.</p>
