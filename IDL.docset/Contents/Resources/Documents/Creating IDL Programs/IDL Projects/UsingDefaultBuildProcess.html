        <h2>Using the Default Build Process</h2>
        <p>A normal project build does the following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Restores save files from referenced projects</li>
            <li value="2">Executes a pre-compile IDL command</li>
            <li value="3">Compiles the PRO files</li>
            <li value="4">Executes the IDL RESOLVE_ALL command</li>
            <li value="5">Executes a post-compile IDL command</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The IDL Build Properties page allows you to use a default build process, or use a custom build command of your own devising. If you choose the default build process, you can select all or a subset of the previous options. The following sections describe these default build options.</p>
        <h3>Restoring Save Files from Referenced Projects</h3>
        <p>It is common practice to create a SAVE file at the end of the project build process that holds the compiled PRO code. This SAVE file should contain all of the PRO code necessary to run the project application. If the project references other projects, the referenced PRO code should also be compiled and inserted in the final project SAVE file. If a referenced project has an associated SAVE file, the referenced SAVE file content can be incorporated into the SAVE file of the project being built.</p>
        <h3>Pre- and Post-Compile Build Commands</h3>
        <p>It is sometimes convenient to execute some code immediately preceding or following a project build. For example, if you want to copy the newly-created SAVE file to another directory after the build, you could create an IDL script to do so, and execute the script after every build. The IDL Workbench gives you the option of specifying both pre- and post-compile build commands. A pre- or post-build command can be a single IDL command or an IDL script file.</p>
        <h3>Compiling all Files</h3>
        <p>Although building a project usually involves compiling the component PRO files, it is not mandatory. If you choose this option, the build process will compile all of the PRO files in the project.</p>
        <p>See <a href="ChangingCompileOrder.html">Changing the Compile Order and Excluding Files from the Build</a> for information on changing a project’s file compilation order and including or excluding files from the build.</p>
        <h3>Resolving All Referenced Routines</h3>
        <p>To explicitly force IDL to compile all routines referenced by routines in the project or referenced projects, use the RESOLVE_ALL routine or select the <b>Execute RESOLVE_ALL</b> build property. If the project references any other projects, the PRO files in the referenced projects are compiled first.</p>
        <h3>SAVE Files</h3>
        <p>An IDL SAVE file created by the project build process contains compiled binary versions of the routines defined in the project PRO code files. The SAVE file can then be distributed to other IDL users or to users who have installed the IDL Virtual Machine. For more information on SAVE files, see Creating SAVE Files of Programs and Data.</p>
        <p>By default, the project build process creates an unlicensed SAVE file. Unlicensed SAVE files can be used by anyone with either a licensed version of IDL or a copy of the IDL Virtual Machine. (Applications that run in the IDL Virtual Machine are subject to some limitations; seeDistributing Virtual Machine Applications for additional information.) If you have purchased a special <i>IDL Developer’s Kit</i> license from ITT Visual Information Solutions, you can create a SAVE file that carries with it its own IDL license, avoiding the IDL Virtual Machine limitations without requiring the end user to purchase an IDL license.</p>
